1. Create a copy of the spreadsheet shared with you and for the next steps start making changes
there.
2. Enriching the data- using any free tool(s) on the market- to find key details about the companies
mentioned including their website, linkedin URL (if any), and a link to their careers page.
3. Find the jobs listings page/URL. It could be the same as the careers page, though in several cases
the careers page and the actual job listings page are usually different.
For exampleHannah Solar's website domain- https://hannahsolar.com
Their careers page- https://hannahsolar.com/about-us/careers/
And their jobs listings page- https://hannahsolar.zohorecruit.com/jobs/Careers
Additionally, one of the job posting pagehttps://hannahsolar.zohorecruit.com/jobs/Careers/425535000005156126/Solar-Installer
4. Now once you have identified the jobs listings page, scrape back all the details you can find for
the job posts listed there. Key details include- job posting URLs, job titles, job locations, date of
job posting, and job descriptions. Hint- each jobs listings page could have anywhere between 0 to
200 job postings. For this assignment you only need to return back details of any 3 job postings
(ideally the most recent ones).
5. Arrange your findings in an excel file (copy of the original sheet shared above) and submit the
form here- submission link . Please note- you need to fill both the subsheets/tabs- Data and
Methodology for the submission to be considered.
6. Please verify the validity of your submission. Do random checks to see if the links you shared are
actually working.
Key detailsRemember you don't need to find each and every job across all the websites. The moment you reach a
total of 200 job postings, you can submit the assignment.
Here's how the math worksIt's not expected that you will be able to find details for all 150 companies (that number could be
anywhere between 120-140). Furthermore, it's possible that only 60-80% of them would have a careers
page, and some percentage of them have posted any job there. It's likely that most of these websites use
job posting services like- Lever, zoho recruit, glassdoor or any other 3rd party provider. On average it's
assumed the companies which have a job opening will have between 4-10 job openings. So, at an
aggregate level there might be ~400-500 jobs. You don't need to find all of them, just 200 are sufficient for
this exercise.
Hint- Identifying these common service providers (Lever, Zoho recruit...) will help you concentrate your
energy and effort.
Though strict warning- if you submit your assignment without actually cleaning up the data output given
by AI agents, or without sharing methodology, the assignment will be auto-rejected.
