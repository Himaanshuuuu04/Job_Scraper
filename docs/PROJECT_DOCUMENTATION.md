# Company Data Enrichment & Job Scraping Tool - Project Documentation

## üìã Project Overview

This project is designed to enrich company data by finding key details about companies and scraping job postings from their careers pages and job listing platforms. The tool specifically addresses the requirements outlined in the assignment to process 150+ companies and extract up to 200 job postings across various platforms.

## üéØ Assignment Requirements

Based on the original assignment, this tool accomplishes:

1. **Data Enrichment**: Finds company websites, LinkedIn URLs, and careers pages
2. **Job Listings Discovery**: Identifies actual job posting pages (distinct from careers pages)
3. **Job Scraping**: Extracts job details including URLs, titles, locations, dates, and descriptions
4. **Target**: Process ~150 companies and collect up to 200 job postings total
5. **Focus on Common Platforms**: Lever, Zoho Recruit, Greenhouse, SmartRecruiters, Workday, etc.

- **Stealth Mode**: playwright-stealth to avoid detection
- **Concurrency**: Controlled parallel processing (2-3 concurrent tabs)
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic and error recovery

### Search Strategy

The tool uses an optimized search approach:

```python
# Example search queries for "Hannah Solar"
search_queries = [
    '"Hannah Solar" site:*.com -site:linkedin.com',  # Official website
    '"Hannah Solar" site:linkedin.com/company',       # LinkedIn page
    '"Hannah Solar" careers site:*.com',              # Careers page
    '"Hannah Solar" site:zohorecruit.com',           # Zoho Recruit jobs
    '"Hannah Solar" site:lever.co',                  # Lever jobs
    # ... more platform-specific searches
]
```

### Data Quality & Validation

- **URL Validation**: HTTP requests to verify link accessibility
- **Duplicate Removal**: Intelligent deduplication across sources
- **Quality Scoring**: Rate data completeness (0-4 scale)
- **Format Standardization**: Consistent output format

## üìà Performance & Scalability

### Current Capacity

- **Success Rate**: 60-80% for URL discovery, 40-60% for job extraction

### Optimization Features
- **Tab Pooling**: Reuse browser tabs for efficiency
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple companies processed simultaneously
- **Search Caching**: Avoid duplicate searches
- **Smart Limits**: Stop processing when reaching 200 job limit
